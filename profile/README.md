# Development Organization Building Conceptualizations and Designs

Responsive development is done according to USWDS
https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/overview/

All projects stem from a use-case which should be a solution to an issue or general benefit for an intended consumer.

Projects should be broken down as a backlog of tasks and priority list.

Considerations for security shall be recorded with resolution steps or deferred to be resolved at a later point.

### Focus
- Establish straightforward implementations
- Re-use solutions to common underlying logic
- Use/research existing tool suites to achieve results before creating one
- Identify procedures and tools to streamline development
- Be aware of dependency licensing (GPL2 vs GPL3 vs BSD etc etc) and their implications and compatibility
